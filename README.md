# Fabric Network with Kafka

Hyperledger Fabric Network with Kafka Consensus on Kubernetes.

## Introduction

The Hyperledger Fabric has introduced Kafka as itâ€™s primary consensus mechanism among the orderers. While in development, for testing purposes, a solo config orderer is used. However, in production, you need to have multiple orderer nodes set up to have fail proof systems.

## Network Topology

A simple Fabric network configuration:

- 2 CAs, 1 for each orgs
- 2 CLI, 1 for each orgs
- 3 Orderers
- 2 Organizations
- 4 peers, 2 for each orgs
- 4 Kafka broker instances
- 3 Zookeeper instances
